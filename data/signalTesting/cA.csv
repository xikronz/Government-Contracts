THE PAYLOADS CONSIST OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) SERVIR ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND VISUALIZATION (ISERV) PATHFINDER, WHICH IS CURRENTLY OPERATING IN THE WINDOW OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH FACILITY (WORF). THE MICROGRAVITY SCIENCE GLOVEBOX (MSG), LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.) DESTINY LABORATORY MODULE, ENABLES SCIENTISTS FROM MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN THE ASSEMBLY AND OPERATION OF EXPERIMENTS IN SPACE WITH MUCH THE SAME DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT THEY HAVE IN THEIR OWN RESEARCH LABORATORIES. DEVELOPED BY THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA) AND MANAGED BY THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION S (NASA'S) MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER (MSFC). THE MSG WAS LAUNCHED ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE ENDEAVOR, STS-111, ISS FLIGHT UF2, IN JUNE 2002. THIS FACILITY OFFERS AN ENCLOSED 255-LITER (9 CUBIC FOOT) WORK AREA ACCESSIBLE TO THE CREW THROUGH GLOVE PORTS AND TO GROUND-BASED SCIENTISTS THROUGH REAL-TIME DATA LINKS AND VIDEO. BECAUSE THE WORK AREA IS SEALED AND HELD AT A NEGATIVE PRESSURE, THE CREW CAN MANIPULATE EXPERIMENT HARDWARE AND SAMPLES WITHOUT THE DANGER OF SMALL PARTS, PARTICULATES, FLUIDS, OR GASSES ESCAPING INTO THE OPEN LABORATORY MODULE. THE MATERIALS SCIENCE RESEARCH RACK (MSRR) LAUNCHED ABOARD SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS ON STS -128 ON AUGUST 28, 2009. MSRR ALLOWS FOR STUDY OF A VARIETY OF MATERIALS INCLUDING METALS, CERAMICS, SEMICONDUCTOR CRYSTALS AND GLASS ABOARD THE ISS. MSRR IS HOUSED IN THE U.S. DESTINY LABORATORY MODULE. MATERIALS SCIENCE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MATERIALS FOR EVERYDAY LIFE HERE ON EARTH. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESEARCH RACK WAS A COOPERATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE MARSHALL CENTER AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY. THE MATERIALS BEING STUDIED ARE FLOWN AND PROCESSED IN SAMPLE CARTRIDGE ASSEMBLIES (SCAS). DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SCAS IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY. THE ISERV PATHFINDER LAUNCHED ON JULY 21, 2012 ABOARD HTV-3. THE ISERV SUB-RACK PAYLOAD IS AN EARTH OBSERVING HIGH-RESOLUTION SYSTEM BASED PRIMARILY ON MODIFIED COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF (COTS) COMPONENTS, WHICH WERE DEVELOPED BY THE NASA-SERVIR PROJECT FOR OPERATION IN THE WORF RACK. THE NASA-SERVIR PROJECT SUPPORTS HUMANITARIAN AID AND DISASTER RESPONSE FOR DEVELOPING NATIONS BY PROVIDING EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATION AND DECISION SUPPORT DATA PRODUCTS. CURRENTLY, SERVIR DOES NOT OWN/CONTROL ANY EARTH OBSERVATION RESOURCES AND MUST TASK COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC ASSETS FOR DATA ACQUISITION RESULTING IN DELAYS AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. THE ISERV PAYLOAD IS THE FIRST STEP IN MITIGATING THIS SITUATION. ISERV IS A PATHFINDER PAYLOAD CHARACTERIZED AS A DEVELOPMENTAL FLIGHT TEST WITH THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH AN ISS-BASED REMOTE SENSING SYSTEM. THE EXPERIENCE GAINED WITH ISERV WILL FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN OPERATIONAL EXTERNALLY MOUNTED IMAGING SYSTEM ABOARD THE ISS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THE ISERV PATHFINDER PAYLOAD INCLUDE: A. DEVELOPMENT OF GENERAL TASKING, UTILIZATION, GROUND COMMANDING, DATA ACQUISITION, AND PROCESSING EXPERIENCE. B. DEVELOPMENT OF IMAGE ACQUISITION, PROCESSING, AND ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES. C. DEVELOPMENT OF FULL COMMANDING, ACQUISITION, AND PROCESSING OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES FOR ISERV HUMANITARIAN AID AND DISASTER MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. D.

THIS NEXTSTEP CONTRACT BUILDS UPON THE SUCCESS OF COMMERCIAL ORBITAL TRANSPORTATION SERVICES SPACE ACT AGREEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND AN EXISTING INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) COMMERCIAL RESUPPLY SERVICES (CRS) CONTRACT. ORBITAL HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED FROM COTS TO THE CRS PROGRAM, FLYING THREE VERY SUCCESSFUL PRESSURIZED CARGO RESUPPLY MISSIONS TO THE ISS, USING THE CYGNUS SPACECRAFT. ORBITAL ALSO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED SPACECRAFT FOR SOLAR SYSTEM EXPLORATION TO INCLUDE THE CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL DAWN MISSION. THIS MISSION WAS LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2007, COMPLETED ITS RENDEZVOUS MISSION AT VESTA IN JULY 2012 AND IS EN ROUTE TO CERES IN EARLY 2015.  WITH SPACE AGENCY BUDGETS CONTINUING TO BE TIGHT, EXPLORATION PLANS NEED TO EMPHASIZE EVOLUTION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS, WHERE COST AND SCHEDULE IS BETTER CONTROLLED, AND DEVELOPMENT RISK REDUCED. SPECIFICALLY, ELEMENTS OF THE CURRENT ISS, INCLUDING CYGNUS, CAN BE EVOLVED TO SUPPORT MORE DISTANT SPACE DESTINATIONS. TO SUPPORT THESE ENDEAVORS, ORBITAL CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT OF CYGNUS AND TO NEXTSTEP ACTIVITIES AND HAVE INVESTED IN THE COTS CRS PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ENDEAVOR.  ORBITAL'S EXPLORATION AUGMENTATION MODULE (BAM) ARCHITECTURE USES A MODULAR, BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES THE CYGNUS SPACECRAFT TO EXPAND CISLUNAR AND LONG DURATION DEEP SPACE TRANSIT HABITATION CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES CRITICAL TO NASAS LONG-TERM EXPLORATION GOALS.  ORBITALS ARCHITECTURE CONCEPT BLENDS IN-PRODUCTION HARDWARE WITH ADAPTATION, EVOLUTION, PLANNING, AND FORWARD THINKING. CYGNUS WILL SERVE AS A MODULAR HABITAT AND TEST PLATFORM FOR QUALIFYING TECHNOLOGIES IN A DISTANT RETROGRADE ORBIT (DRO) OR IN A LOW EARTH ORBIT (LEO), EITHER WHILE ATTACHED TO THE ISS OR AS A FREE-FLYER. USING THE EXISTING, OPERATIONAL CYGNUS TO PERFORM THESE MISSIONS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF DECREASING OVERALL DEVELOPMENT TIME AND COSTS, AND FREEING UP RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE SPENT ON DEVELOPING A SPACECRAFT TO FOCUS ON CULTIVATING MISSION ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES.  THE GOAL IS TO HAVE A CYGNUS DERIVED EAM DEPLOYED IN CISLUNAR SPACE BEFORE 2020. THIS SPACECRAFT WILL BE THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK IN SUPPORTING BOTH COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES. THE PROPOSED EFFORT FOR THIS NEXTSTEP BAA PHASE I, INVOLVES DEFINING AN EAM ARCHITECTURE AND CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS) THAT ADDRESSES COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND NASA EXPLORATION OBJECTIVES, TECHNOLOGY MATURATION PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, AND TO IDENTIFY TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AND DEMONSTRATED IN THE ISSILEO ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.  TO MATURE HABITATION TECHNOLOGIES, THE CONTRACTOR WILL IDENTIFY STATE OF THE ART (SOA) TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS NASA TECHNOLOGY AREAS (TAS) DEFINED IN THE NASA TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP.
